# Piano Learning plan Generator using CrewAI

Welcome to the {{Piano Learning plan Generato}} Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This template is designed to help you set up a multi-agent AI system with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. Our goal is to enable your agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.13 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```


## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution in streamlit UI, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command initializes the Crews, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the streamlit application where user can create piano learning plan according to their current profile.
